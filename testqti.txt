24. 3.00 mol of potassium chloride (KCl) [molar mass = 74.55 g/mol] is dissolved in final 3.00 kg water. What is the **molality** of the KCl solution?
a) 0.500 m
*b) 1.00 m
c) 2.24 m
d) 99.4 m
25. Which statement is the LEAST relevant or is INCORRECT regarding the colligative properties of a solution?
a) These properties depend only on the **number** of solute particles dissolved in the solvent.
b) **Molality** (*m*) is the required unit of concentration for calculating freezing and boiling point changes.
c) A solution's change in boiling point and freezing point are examples of colligative properties
*d) To understand the effect of the solute, you must know the **oxidation numbers** of the atoms in the compound.
